<p>In this post, we would like to talk about how smash dominated EVO last year.</p>
<p>For all of you who have been living under a rock for the past decade, EVO (Evolution Championship Series) is the biggest e-sports event for fighting games in the world. Contestants from all over the glove travel annually to Las Vegas (USA) to prove they are the best in their game.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the tournament in 2002, it has featured the most popular fighting games of each year, including various installments from popular series like Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat… Smash is not a fighting game like all the rest, some would like to define it as a party game, and it has a different target from all the other games. Despite that, the Smash video games have been a big part of EVO since their debut, and now they are more popular than ever before.</p>
<p>EVO 2019 took place from August 2nd to August 4th at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. Over 9000 people signed to participate in the tournament. The game lineup was: Tekken 7, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle, Mortal Kombat 11, Samurai Shodown, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[st] and finally our Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. That’s right, our newest game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate made its debut in EVO 2019 replacing the previous installment Smash Wii U, AND IT WAS AMAZING!!! While being its first time in EVO and sharing the venue with favorites such as Tekken 7 and Street Fighter V, the new Smash game managed to get 3.534 entrants signed up and a pot size of $35,340, making it the biggest game in the whole tournament by almost doubling the entrants of the second game with most participants and it also became the largest Smash tournament of all time. We could not have hoped for a better picture. Super Smash Bros. Melee was also in the tournament as a side event and managed to get 111 participants signed up.</p>
<p>The Super Smash Bros. Ultimate finals were the last event in the tournament and the one everybody was waiting for. We got to see some of the most amazing matches ever and in the end, the Mexican professional player Leonardo López Pérez, who plays under the alias of  FOX|MVG|MkLeo, beat some of the favorite Japanese and American players, winning the tournament and crowning himself as the best smash player of the year. He played the recently released Character “Joker” with great success showing us its unlimited potential. MkLeo took home a total prize of $21,204. The American Gavin Dempsey (TSM|Tweek) with Pokémon Trainer managed to get second place and a prize of $7,068 while the French William Belaid (Solary|Gluttony) with Wario got third place and $3,534. We would like to congratulate all the winners and thank all the people who participate in this tournament supporting our game. We would also like to congratulate all the winners in all the other events in the venue. Especially the underdog vSlash|Arslan Ash, who won the Tekken 7 tournament, a Player from Pakistan who showed everyone that there are many countries out there with amazing players that are unable to travel and participate in tournaments like this for economic or social reasons. Sponsors should look in places like those and maybe they will find the new smash champion, who knows.</p>

<p>Overall, we could not be happier with how everything unfolded, and we are extremely grateful for your support. We will also try our best to give you the best Smash games we can make. EVO 2020 will take place from July 31st to August 2nd and Ultimate will also be in it, but we are sad to hear that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain if the tournament will be able to take place, will be delayed or will be cancelled. We can only hope for the best and remind you to wash your hands and stay safe. The best way to do that is to remain home playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and maybe you can be the next Smash EVO Champion!
